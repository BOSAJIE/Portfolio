## About me
I am a positive-thinking person who possesses two sides of power. On one hand, I am organised, structured and attentive to detail due to my background as a Software QA Engineer. And on the other, due to my personality, I love to communicate with people and solve problems.

I got my Bachelor's Degree from Connecticut College and have been a Fulbright Scholar from the Fulbright Program for 6 years. My internship with Invoice Maker involved evaluating software functionality and creating effective test cases to ensure product quality.

Now, I wish to exploit my research and analytical skills in software testing. Currently, I am intensively studying techniques and tools by attending online courses and testing web applications created for learning purposes.

I would be extremely happy to apply obtained knowledge to mobile tesing, web testing, functional testing, and ui testing of an operational product and gain hands-on experience. It is a crucial step in my current career goal — to become a mid-level software tester in 2 years.
